# Extended Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

In this project a Kalman Filter estimates the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements with the RMSE values lower than the required tolerance. 

## Dependencies

- cmake >= 3.5
- All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
- make >= 4.1
  - Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  - Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  - Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  - Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  - Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](([https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/))
  - Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF `


## Running the Program

1. Download the simulator and open it. In the main menu screen select Project 1: Bicycle tracker with EKF.
2. Once the scene is loaded you can hit the START button to observe how the object moves and how measurement markers are positioned in the data set. Also for more experimentation, "Data set 2" is included which is a reversed version of "Data set 1", also the second data set starts with a radar measurement where the first data set starts with a lidar measurement. At any time you can press the PAUSE button, to pause the scene or hit the RESTART button to reset the scene. Also the ARROW KEYS can be used to move the camera around, and the top left ZOOM IN/OUT buttons can be used to focus the camera. Pressing the ESCAPE KEY returns to the simulator main menu.
3. The [EKF project Github repository README](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project/tree/project_v2) has more detailed instructions for installing and using c++ uWebScoketIO.

**NOTE:** Currently hitting Restart or switching between Data sets only refreshes the simulator state and not the Kalman Filter's saved results. The current procedure for refreshing the Kalman Filter is to close the connection, `ctrl+c` and reopen it, `./ExtendedKF`. If you don't do this when trying to run a different Data set or running the same Data set multiple times in a row, the RMSE values will become large because of the the previous different filter results still being observed in memory.

##Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

- indent using spaces
- set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Generating Additional Data

This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project resources page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/382ebfd6-1d55-4487-84a5-b6a5a4ba1e47)
for instructions and the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/748/view).

## Hints!

- You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! We'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

- /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
- /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.



This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF

Note that the programs that need to be written to accomplish the project are src/FusionEKF.cpp, src/FusionEKF.h, kalman_filter.cpp, kalman_filter.h, tools.cpp, and tools.h

The program main.cpp has already been filled out, but feel free to modify it.

Here is the main protcol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]

### Explanation of the Data File

The github repo contains one data file:

- `data/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt`

Here is a screenshot of the first data file:

The simulator will be using this data file, and feed main.cpp values from it one line at a time.

![data-snapshot](./images/data-snapshot.png)

Screenshot of Data File

Each row represents a sensor measurement where the first column tells you if the measurement comes from radar (R) or lidar (L).

For a row containing radar data, the columns are: **sensor_type, rho_measured, phi_measured, rhodot_measured, timestamp, x_groundtruth, y_groundtruth, vx_groundtruth, vy_groundtruth, yaw_groundtruth, yawrate_groundtruth**.

For a row containing lidar data, the columns are: **sensor_type, x_measured, y_measured, timestamp, x_groundtruth, y_groundtruth, vx_groundtruth, vy_groundtruth, yaw_groundtruth, yawrate_groundtruth**.

Whereas radar has three measurements (rho, phi, rhodot), lidar has two measurements (x, y).

You will use the measurement values and timestamp in your Kalman filter algorithm. Groundtruth, which represents the actual path the bicycle took, is for calculating **root mean squared error**.

Yaw and yaw rate will be introduced in the UKF lecture (you will use the same data set for the UKF project). You do not need to worry about yaw and yaw rate ground truth values.

### Reading in the Data

We have provided code that will read in and parse the data files for you. This code is in the `main.cpp` file. The `main.cpp`file creates instances of a **MeasurementPackage**.

If you look inside 'main.cpp', you will see code like:

```
MeasurementPackage meas_package;
meas_package.sensor_type_ = MeasurementPackage::LASER;
meas_package.raw_measurements_ = VectorXd(2);
meas_package.raw_measurements_ << px, py;
meas_package.timestamp_ = timestamp;

```

and

```
vector<VectorXd> ground_truth;
VectorXd gt_values(4);
gt_values(0) = x_gt;
gt_values(1) = y_gt; 
gt_values(2) = vx_gt;
gt_values(3) = vy_gt;
ground_truth.push_back(gt_values);

```

The code reads in the data file line by line. The measurement data for each line gets pushed onto a `measurement_pack_list`. The ground truth [px,py,vx,vy] for each line in the data file gets pushed onto`ground_truth`so RMSE can be calculated later from `tools.cpp`.

### Overview of a Kalman Filter: Initialize, Predict, Update

To review what we learned in the extended Kalman filter lectures, let's discuss the three main steps for programming a Kalman filter:

- **initializing** Kalman filter variables
- **predicting** where our object is going to be after a time step Î”t
- **updating** where our object is based on sensor measurements

Then the prediction and update steps repeat themselves in a loop.

To measure how well our Kalman filter performs, we will then calculate **root mean squared error** comparing the Kalman filter results with the provided ground truth.

These three steps (initialize, predict, update) plus calculating RMSE encapsulate the entire extended Kalman filter project.

### Files in the Github src Folder

The files you need to work with are in the `src` folder of the github repository.

- `main.cpp` - communicates with the Term 2 Simulator receiving data measurements, calls a function to run the Kalman filter, calls a function to calculate RMSE
- `FusionEKF.cpp` - initializes the filter, calls the predict function, calls the update function
- `kalman_filter.cpp`- defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar
- `tools.cpp`- function to calculate RMSE and the [Jacobian matrix](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/3612b91d-9c33-47ad-8067-a572a6c93837/concepts/ad446f45-d757-41b0-be5d-3f0a28d3dfd1)

The only files you need to modify are `FusionEKF.cpp`, `kalman_filter.cpp`, and `tools.cpp`.

### How the Files Relate to Each Other

Here is a brief overview of what happens when you run the code files:

1. `Main.cpp` reads in the data and sends a sensor measurement to `FusionEKF.cpp`
2. `FusionEKF.cpp` takes the sensor data and initializes variables and updates variables. The Kalman filter equations are not in this file. `FusionEKF.cpp` has a variable called `ekf_`, which is an instance of a `KalmanFilter` class. The `ekf_` will hold the matrix and vector values. You will also use the `ekf_` instance to call the predict and update equations.
3. The `KalmanFilter` class is defined in `kalman_filter.cpp` and `kalman_filter.h`. You will only need to modify 'kalman_filter.cpp', which contains functions for the prediction and update steps.

Regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make.
